# Here we use the `<<-` operator to assign a value to an object 
# in an environment that is different from the current 
# environment. Here are two functions, namely 'makeCacheMatrix' 
# and 'cacheSolve',  to create a special object that 
# stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

# This function, `makeCacheMatrix` creates a special "matrix", 
# which is a list containing a function to

# 1.  set the value of the matrix
# 2.  get the value of the matrix
# 3.  set the value of the inverse
# 4.  get the value of the inverse


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  # This function creates caches for the inverse of a nonsingluar matrix
  # Example: xx <- matrix(c(1,2,1,0,1,0,1,2,-1),3,3)
  #          cxx <- makeCacheMatrix(xx) 
  
  ix <- NULL
  
  # set the matrix
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    ix <<- NULL
  }
  
  # get the matrix
  get <- function() x
  
  # set the inverse; 'solve' is utilized to find inverse
  setinverse <- function(solve) ix <<- solve
  
  # get the inverse
  getinverse <- function() ix
  
  # create the list
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


# This function calculates the inverse of the special 'matrix' 
# created with the 'makeCacheMatrix' function. It first checks 
# to see if the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it 
# 'get's the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
# Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets 
# the value of the inverse in the cache via the 'setinverse' 
# function. 


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  # Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x' made by makeCacheMatrix
  # Example: To get the inverse of matrix 'xx', make cachematrix 'cxx'
  #          cacheSolve(cxx)
  
  ix <- x$getinverse()
  
  # if 'inverse' exists in the cache uses it
  if(!is.null(ix)) {	
    message("getting cached data")
    return(ix)	
  }
  
  # if inverse is not in the cache it calculates
  data <- x$get()
  ix <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(ix)
  ix
}
